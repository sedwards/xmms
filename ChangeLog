	* Output/OSS/audio.c (oss_set_audio_params): The format conversion

	* xmms/playlistwin.c (playlistwin_update_info): The playlist
	counters were wrapping around after 2^31ms (about 600h).  It now
	wraps around after 2^32s (about 136 years).  If you find that
	annoying, get a 64bit computer!

	* xmms/fft.c: Removed a unused variable.

Thu Mar  8 17:18:31 CET 2001  Espen Skoglund  <esk@ira.uka.de>

	* libxmms/titlestring.[ch], libxmms/Makefile.am: New library
	interface for formatting titlestrings.

	* Input/main.[cg], Input/prefswin.c: Added option for configuring
	generic title strings.

	* Input/cdaudio/cdaudio.[ch], Input/cdaudio/configure.c: Use
	xmms_get_titlestring() to format titlestring.  Add option to
	override generic titlestring.

	* Input/cdaudio/cdinfo.[ch]: Removed cdda_cdinfo_get_name().

Thu Mar  8 00:19:33 EST 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* configure.in, Ouput/Makefile.am, Output/solaris/*: Solaris
	plugin merged.  Thanks to John Riddoch, Santosh Salunkhe, Julian
	Yip and others.

	* xmms/about.c (credit_text): Added John Riddoch.

	* AUTHORS: Synced with about.c.

	* Output/OSS/configure.c, Output/OSS/init.c, Output/OSS/OSS.h:
	Added the possibility to configure the mixer device manually.

	* Input/vorbis/vorbis.c (vorbis_play_loop): No need to set the
	title on stop.
	A couple of other minor cleanups.

	* xmms/main.c: Redid the handling of commandline arguments a bit.
	This fixes some longstanding problems with sending commands to a
	running xmms if allow multiple instances is on.

	* xmms/main.c: player_visible is now saved on exit, and handled
	properly on start.

	* xmms/dock.c, xmms/main.c, xmms/equalizer.c, xmms/playlistwin.c:
	Things should work a little better if both wm decorations and save
	window positions is on. 

	* xmms/main.[ch], xmms/prefswin.c, xmms/controlsocket.c: When
	hiding the window with wm decorations on we need to really hide
	the widget.

	* xmms/main.c, xmms/equalizer.c, xmms/playlistwin.c: Use
	gdk_window_get_root_origin() instead of
	gdk_window_get_deskrelative_origin() in configure handlers.  This
	works better with wm decorations on.  Hopefully it does not break
	anything else either.

	* configure.in: Fixed a test expression.

Wed Mar  5 08:31:41 2001  Olle Hällnäs  <olle@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.c: added gdk_window_raise(filebrowser->window);
	so filebrowser will be raised if already opened.

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): New translation: Indonesian (id).

	* Input/mpg123/dxhead.[ch]: Whitespace changes.

Thu Mar  1 18:54:55 CET 2001  Espen Skoglund  <esk@ira.uka.de>

	* configure.in: Added checking for old style FreeBSD -pthread flag
	to gcc.  Works with both -CURRENT and older branches of FreeBSD.
 
Sat Feb 24 12:24:15 CET 2001  Peter Alm <peter@xmms.org>
	
	* xmms/textbox.c: Fixed a mutex problem in the textbox widget,
	should resolve some issues in the vorbis plugin.
		
Fri Feb 23 23:11:11 CST 2001  Zinx Verituse <zinx@xmms.org>

	* Input/vorbis/vorbis.c: set title to NULL now, to avoid double
	g_free()ing of it.. No more random crashes :)

Thu Feb 22 16:30:30 CST 2001  Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>

	* xmms.spec.in: Changed name of mesa subpackage to gl.
	And added Obsoletes: xmms-mesa.

Wed Feb 21 20:13:00 PST 2001  Jack Moffitt   <jack@icecast.org>

	* xmms/Input/vorbis.c: make some cosmetic changes to title
	display

Tue Feb 13 20:07:09 EST 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/playlist.c (playlist_selection_enqueue): Fixed a memory
	leak. 

	* xmms/main.c (create_popups): The playlist was unintentionally
	shown before the mainwin on start, and this was confusing some
	windowmanagers. 

	* xmms/playlistwin.c (playlistwin_set_hints): Set base-size to the
	same as minimum size.

	* xmms/main.c, xmms/equalizer.c: Reverted the adding to playlist
	when pressing middle mouse buttom from mainwin and equalizer.

	* xmms/main.c, xmms/playlistwin.c, xmms/vis.[ch]: Fixed a problem
	with the visualization when toggling wm decorations.

Thu Feb  8 16:18:20 EST 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

Tue Feb  6 10:55:33 2001  Espen Skoglund  <esk@ira.uka.de>

	* configure.in, xmms/main.c (main): Use srandom() or possibly
	srandomdev() instead of srand().

	* xmms/playlist.c (playlist_shuffle_list) (playlist_play),
	xmms/mkdtemp.c (mkdtemp): Changed rand() to random().

	* xmms/about.c (show_about_window): Added year 2001.
	(credit_text): Sorted alphabetically.

Sun Feb  4 22:29:20 EST 2001  Logan Hanks  <logan@vt.edu>

	* xmms/main.c, xmms/equalizer.c, xmms/playlistwin.c: Pressing
	button 2 (middle button) in the main, equalizer, or playlist
	windows causes XMMS to retrieve the contents of the clipboard and
	add to the playlist.  A double click causes the playlist to be
	cleared.  Credit goes to Aaron Krowne (akrowne@vt.edu) for the
	idea and some code.

Sun Feb  4 11:33:34 EST 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* General/joystick/joy.c (joyapp_read_buttoncmd): A string that
	should not be translated was marked for translation.  Some other
	minor cleanups.

Mon Jan 29 18:40:34 CET 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.c (create_popups): Fixed radio items when running
	translated. 

Sun Jan 28 23:03:41 PST 2001  Jack Moffitt <jack@icecast.org>

	* Input/vorbis/vorbis.c: fixed small bug

	* Input/vorbis/http.c: changed file extension to .ogg (oops)

	* Input/vorbis/vorbis.c: implemented vorbis streaming

	* Input/vorbis/: several new files vorbis streaming

	* Input/mpg123/mpg123.c: don't grab all http streams, leave the
  	'.ogg' streams for the vorbis plugin.

Fri Jan 26 20:16:05 EST 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/prefswin.c (prefswin_apply_changes), xmms/main.[ch],
	xmms/equalizer.[ch], xmms/playlistwin.[ch]: Destroy and recreate
	all windows when toggling wm decorations.

	* xmms/playlistwin.c (playlistwin_set_hints): Don't set maximum
	values too high.

Thu Jan 25 09:10:07 CST 2001  Zinx Verituse <zinx@xmms.org>

	* xmms/playlistwin.c: Workaround for my crazy WM (or gtk+?). It
	seems to think it can decide where the window goes if resizing is
	turned on, so I've turned WM resize off unless using the WM's
	decorations..  Let me know if this causes problems (seems fine here)

Thu Jan 25 02:30:30 CET 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.c (set_doublesize): Fixed a possible deadlock on start
	if doublesize was enabled.  Hopefully without breaking any of the
	docking when toggling doublesize. 
	(main): Add check for sched_get_priority_max(). 
	(create_popups): Cleanup.

	* configure.in: Add check for sched_get_priority_max() which is
	missing on OpenBSD.
	Some other minor cleanups.

Thu Jan 25 00:17:08 CET 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* Input/cdaudio/cdaudio.c (cdda_init): Fix compilation on
	*BSD/Solaris.  Patch by Jonathan Irwin <jmi25@cam.ac.uk>.

	* xmms/main.c (setup_main_window): Set the autoscroll songname
	correctly on start.  Patch by Jonathan Irwin <jmi25@cam.ac.uk>

	* xmms/controlsocket.c (check_ctrlsocket): Fixed a missing break
	statement.  Patch by Ian Campbell <ijc25@cam.ac.uk>

Tue Jan 23 16:46:14 CST 2001  Zinx Verituse <zinx@xmms.org>

	* xmms/playlist_popup.c: Move before showing the popup. People
	were complaining about it being in the upper-left corner for
	an instant..

	FreeBSD.  (Known to cause audio glitches during playback.)

	* configure.in, {Plugindirs}/Makefile.am: Added environment
	variable INPUT_PLUGINS and friends that can be used for manually
	overriding which plugins to be built.  (Useful during automated
	building of XMMS.)

Mon Jan 18 01:04:45 CET 2001  Olle Hällnäs  <olle@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.c: added Håvard's fix to display the 
	  icon in KDE2's taskbar.

Mon Jan  8 03:02:09 CET 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.c (read_config): Fixed a cut'n'paste typo.

	* Input/vorbis/vorbis.c: Fixed some rare deadlocks.

Sat Jan  6 19:00:58 CET 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/playlistwin.c (playlistwin_set_shade): Request the size we
	used to have when unshading with wm decorations on.

	* xmms/prefswin.c (prefswin_toggle_wm_decorations): Set wm hints
	for the playlist window.

Sat Jan  6 16:42:14 CET 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* Input/vorbis/vorbis.c: Fixed a couple of places where we were
	not holding the mutex while calling ov_*() functions.

Thu Jan  4 02:42:04 GMT 2001  Chris Wilson <jakdaw@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.c (read_config): Fixed segfault when ~/.xmms/config
	was missing.

Wed Jan  3 23:44:44 CET 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	doublesize button on the main window from working correctly.

Tue Jan  2 19:20:06 CET 2001  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* Input/mpg123/layer3.c (III_i_stereo): Fixed a bug that would
	cause crashes on some mp3's using intensive stereo.
	(III_dequantize_sample): Commented out the high frequency cutting
	that had sneaked in when syncing with mpg123 cvs.

Sun Dec 31 18:15:03 CET 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.[ch], xmms/playlistwin.[ch], xmms/equalizer.[ch],
	prefswin.c: It is now possible to show windowmanager decorations.
	This feature is still a bit experimental.

	* xmms/main.[ch], xmms/playlist.c (playlist_play): Disable the
	seekbars before starting to play.  This will prevent us from
	sending seek calls to input plugins before they have called
	->set_info().

	Patch by Eugene Tsyrklevich <eugene@securityarchitects.com>

	* Input/vorbis/vorbis.c: Handle output plugin errors gracefully.

	* Input/cdaudio/cdaudio.c (is_mounted), Input/cdaudio/cdaudio.h,
	configure.in: Try to use getmntinfo() for systems that do not have
	getmntent().  (Only checked on FreeBSD.)  Thanks to Vladimir
	Kushnir <vkushnir@Alfacom.net>.

	* General/joystick/about.c, General/joystick/configure.c,
	General/joystick/joy.[ch]: Applied patch from Justin Wake
	<justin@globalsoft.com.au> to support more than 4 buttons in the
	joystick plugin.

	* Input/tonegen/tonegen.c: Marked string for translation.

Sun Dec 31 00:19:16 CET 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/playlistwin.c, xmms/skin.c, xmms/skinwin.c: Fixed some
	compiler warnings.

	* xmms/main.c (main): Use setuid() instead of setreuid() when
	dropping any root privilegies.

	* Input/vorbis/vorbis.c (vorbis_get_song_info): Use the mutex here
	too.  Patch by "Zack Weinberg" <zackw@stanford.edu>

	* Input/vorbis/vorbis.c: Reorganised a bit and reintended the
	entire file.  Fixed some minor issues related to seeking, and
	marked some strings for translation.

	* xmms/skin.c (skin_decompress_skin): Removed a debugging message.

	* xmms/mkdtemp.c (mkdtemp): Use rand() instead of random() like
	the rest of xmms does.

Thu Dec 28 15:49:31 CET 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.[ch], xmms/playlistwin.c, xmms/equalizer.c,

	decompressing skins.

	* configure.in: Check for mkdtemp();

	* xmms/mkdtemp.c, xmms/Makefile.am: An implementation of mkdtemp()
	for systems that are missing it.  Derived from the implementation
	in the FreeBSD libc.

	* xmms/prefswin.[ch]: Lots of minor cleanups.

Fri Dec 22 23:05:55 GMT 2000  Chris Wilson <jakdaw@xmms.org>

	* FAQ, Input/mpg123/README: Updates and typo fixes from 'Nevermind'
	* TODO: Added that need to move streaming code out of the mpg123
	plugin.

	libmikmod package dependencies to complain properly if
	the lib was available but not libmikmod-config.

Sun Dec 10 23:54:29 CET 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.c, xmms/playlistwin.c: Cleaned up various abuse of
	manipulating internal Gtk+ data.  This should make us more robust
	against translations with errors.

	* xmms/controlsocket.c (check_ctrlsocket): input_seek() could get
	called on files without length due to a signedness error.  Caused
	segfault when xmms_remote_jump_to_time() was called.

	* xmms/hints.c: Removed some timestamps that is not necessary
	according to the Gnome wm spec.

Wed Nov 29 19:11:12 CET 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/playlist_list.c (playlist_list_draw_string_wc): Apparently
	libc and X might have a different opinion on what a wide character
	string is.  Thanks to Chun-Chung Chen <cjj@u.washington.edu> for
	helping to sort this out.  I'm hoping I got it right this time.

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): New language: Galician (gl).

	dubious function prototype.

	* xmms/eq_graph.c (eqgraph_draw): Call skin_get_eq_spline_colors()
	correctly.

Sun Nov 19 14:40:45 CET 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/prefswin.c: Browsing fonts, and then pressing cancel in the
	font selection dialog was not handled correct, also start browsing
	with the font currently in the entry.
	Patch by Thomas Nilsson	<thomas@xmms.org>

	* Input/mpg123/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Make sure the 3dnow
	specific files gets included when making dist.

	* xmms/main.c (mainwin_jump_to_file): Marked a string for
	translation.  Patch by Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>.

	* xmms/playlistwin.c: The sub-misc menu was not translated. 
	Patch by Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>.

	* xmms/hints.c: Use macros supplied by GDK instead of casting to
	Gdk*Private types.

	* xmms/fullscreen.c, xmms/util.c (create_dblsize_image): Ditto.

Wed Nov  8 21:38:57 CET 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/playlist.c (playlist_ins_dir): The shuffle list was
	regenerated more than necessary.  Adding deep direcory structures
	should be *much* faster now.  

	* xmms/playlist_list.c (playlist_list_move_down): A mutex was
	locked instead of unlocked, and this was causing deadlocks when
	dragging entries to the bottom.

	* xmms/playlist_list.c (playlist_list_draw): Don't use the wide
	character stuff unless use_fontsets is enabled.  I have a feeling
	this is going to cause problems, and most people wont need it.

Sun Oct 29 11:00:00 PDT  2000  Jack Moffitt   <jack@icecast.org>

	* added Input/vorbis dir with vorbis plugin

	* Input/mpg123/http.c: Rewrote most of the udp metadata
	streaming.  It had some serious bugs, it was leaking both threads
	and sockets.

	metadata streaming was not possible to disable because of a typo.
	(mpg123_configure): Changed a string.

	fixed glibc instead.

	* xmms/playlist_list.c (playlist_list_draw): Convert the strings
	to wide character strings before modifying them to avoid
	destroying multibyte character strings.
	Based on a patch by Isaac Kar-Keung To <kkto@csis.hku.hk>
	Fixed playlist locking.

	* libxmms/formatter.c: Added a #include.

	* Input/mpg123/layer3.c (REFRESH_MASK): Added a cast, supposed to
	fix a problem seen on alpha.

Mon Oct  2 15:12:48 CEST 2000  Peter Alm  <peter@xmms.org>
		
	* xmms/pluginenum.c: Removed dlclose() of plugins. Fix for buggy
	RH7 glibc.

 	Kimura Takuhiro (3DNow! support).

Sun Oct  1 02:05:48 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* libxmms/util.c: Always #include sys/time.h.  This is supposed to
	fix a build problem on OpenBSD.

	* libxmms/configure.in: Added a couple of checks for header
	files. 

	* Input/cdaudio/cdindex.c: We #included xmlmemory.h for no good
	reason, and this gave problems when building against old versions
	of libxml.

Tue Sep 26 23:09:06 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): New languages: Azerbaijani (az),
	Italian (it).

	* Input/mpg123/id3_frame.c (id3_read_frame): Ignore id3 frames
	that we do not recognise.  This fixes a bug where we could
	dereference a uninitialized pointer.

Tue Sep 12 18:33:56 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* Input/mpg123/common.c (read_id3v2_tag): If id3v2 tags were

	* xmms/playlist_list.c (playlist_list_draw), prefswin.c,
	main.[ch]: Added a option to load the playlist font using
	fontsets.  I hope this will make everyone happy.

Sat Aug 19 22:41:47 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	(prefswin_glist_clicked, prefswin_vlist_clicked): Likewise.
	Patch by Jason Merrill <jason@redhat.com>

	* Output/disk_writer/disk_writer.c (disk_open): Use filename of
	the input file instead of the title to make the name of the wav
	file.

Thu Aug 10 19:45:04 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* Output/esd/mixer.c: Don't try to set local mixer if playing to a

	* Input/mpg123/fileinfo.c (mpg123_file_info_box): One string made
	translateable.  Thanks to Hiroshi Takekawa
	<takekawa@sr3.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp>. 

	* xmms/dock.c (dock_shade): Fixed another case where windows were
	moved incorrectly.

Sat Aug  5 16:11:15 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/skin.[ch], xmms/eq_graph.c, eq_slider.c, equalizer.c,
	hslider.c, main.c, menurow.c, monostereo.c, number.c, pbutton.c,
	playlist_popup.c, playlist_slider.c, playlistwin.c, playstatus.c,
	tbutton.c, textbox.c : Changed the drawing of skin pixmaps to not
	draw anything that is missing from .bmp files.  Previously we just
	used the default skin.  It seems like a lot of skins have started
	depend on this "feature" lately.

	* xmms/skin.[ch], xmms/hslider.c: Removed the hack that prevented
	the knobs to be drawn if they were missing from the skin.

	* xmms/skin.c (skin_get_mask), xmms/main.c, xmms/equalizer.c:
	Moved the transparency masks from get_skin_pixmap().

	* xmms/skin.c (load_skin_color): Make sure the default values are
	zero.

Wed Aug  2 11:05:17 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* Input/mpg123/layer3.c, Input/mpg123/layer2.c,
	Input/mpg123/layer1.c, Input/mpg123/common.c,
	Input/mpg123/mpg123.[ch], Input/mpg123/getbits.[chs],
	Input/mpg123/Makefile.am: Merged some bugfixes and optimizations
	from mpg123.  Thanks to Michael Hipp et al.

	* Input/mpg123/tables.h: Renamed this file to l2tables.h.

	* xmms/dock.c (dock_shade): Fixed a problem that caused windows to
	move incorrectly when shading a window close to the top of the
	screen with another window docked on the side of the window.

Mon Jul 31 23:46:35 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	(input_file_info_box): Ditto.

	* Input/idcin/idcin.c, Input/mpg123/mpg123.c,
	Input/tonegen/tonegen.c, Input/cdaudio/cdaudio.c,
	Input/mikmod/plugin.c, Input/wav/wav.c, Output/esd/esd.c,
	Output/OSS/OSS.c, Output/disk_writer/disk_writer.c,
	Effect/stereo_plugin/stereo.c, Effect/echo_plugin/echo.c,
	Effect/voice/voice.c, General/joystick/joy.c, General/ir/ir.c,
	General/song_change/song_change.c,
	Visualization/opengl_spectrum/opengl_spectrum.c,
	Visualization/blur_scope/blur_scope.c,
	Visualization/sanalyzer/spectrum.c:  Made plugin descriptions
	translateable. 

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Moved the intl dir so it is compiled
	first, this should fix some problems that were encountered when
	using the included gettext.

	* Input/mikmod/plugin.c, Input/mikmod/mikmod-plugin.h: Changed
	some defines into a enum.

Mon Jul 31 11:32:26 CDT 2000  Ryan Weaver <ryanw@xmms.org>

Sat Jul 29 02:58:07 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	-I$(top_builddir)/intl here.

Sat Jul 29 01:28:03 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/skin.c: The converting of hex values to integers (from
	pledit.txt)  was always	slightly wrong.
	Patch by James M. Cape <jcape@jcinteractive.com>.
	(load_skin_color): Handle short strings properly.

	* xmms/skin.[ch], xmms/hslider.c: Winamp does not draw the knob on
	the mainwin volume and balance sliders if they are missing from
	the skin.  Now we don't do that either.
	Reported by Petre Rodan <rodan@subdimension.com>.

	* Input/cdaudio/cdaudio.c, Output/OSS/audio.c,
	Output/OSS/configure.c, Output/OSS/mixer.c, Output/esd/mixer.c,
	configure.in: It is possible to set default output and mixer
	device for the OSS plugin from configure.
	Patch by Adam J. Richter <adam@yggdrasil.com>.

Fri Jul 28 18:34:46 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/controlsocket.c (ctrlsocket_func): Use functions from
	playlist.c instead of messing around with the playlist.
	(check_ctrlsocket): Use the same types on both sides of the
	controlsocket (fixed for CMD_SET_EQ_BAND).

	* xmms/playlist.[ch]: Wrote some utility functions:
	playlist_get_filename(), playlist_get_songtitle() and
	playlist_get_songtime(). 

Fri Jul 21 01:09:23 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* Input/cdaudio/cdindex.c, Input/cdaudio/Makefile.am: Support for
	libxml2.  Patch by Dave Yearke <yearke@eng.buffalo.edu> and some
	additional hacking by me.

	* Input/cdaudio/http.c (http_get): Send the document path, not the
	enture url.
	Patch by Dave Yearke <yearke@eng.buffalo.edu>.

	* configure.in: Removed the version check for libxml.  Export
	XML_CFLAGS.

Tue Jul 19 00:54:22 CEST 2000  Olle Hällnäs  <olle@xmms.org>

	* xmms/playlist_list.c: Changed gdk_fontset_load() back
	  to gdk_font_load(), didn't work with swedish chars.

Tue Jul 18 23:35:56 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/playlistwin.c (playlistwin_update_sinfo): Use
	__get_playlist_position() now.

	* libxmms/xmmsctrl.c (xmms_remote_get_eq_preamp): Never returned
	anything. 
	(xmms_remote_get_eq): Avoid void pointer arithmetics.

	* xmms/skin.c (skin_create_transparent_mask): Fixed a minor memory
	leak. 

	* xmms/playlist_list.c (playlist_list_motion_cb): Fixed a problem
	when dragging entries downwards.
	Patch by Aaron Lehmann <aaronl@vitelus.com>

Mon Jul 17 23:26:14 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/playlist.c (playlist_next): Fixed a race condition where we
	changed the playlist position before stopping input plugins.  This
	could make playlist_set_info() update the wrong entry.
	(playlist_prev): Ditto.
	(playlist_eof_reached): Ditto.

	* xmms/playlist.c, xmms/controlsocket.c, xmms/main.c, xmms/util.c:
	Every function that modifies the playlist directly calls
	playlist_generate_shuffle_list().  Removed calls to this function
	from other files.

	* xmms/playlist.[ch] (get_playlist_position): get_playlist_position()
	should now be called without the playlist mutex.  Use
	__get_playlist_position() when holding the playlist mutex.

	* xmms/util.c (util_filebrowser_is_dir): Removing of trailing
	slashes should not be necessary, so it was removed.

	* xmms/main.c (mainwin_configure): Fixed a empty return value.

	* gnomexmms/gnomexmms.c, wmxmms/wmxmms.c : Use gtk_set_locale()
	instead of set_locale().

	* xmms/main.c (main): Dropped set_locale().  gtk_set_locale()
	should be enough.

	* xmms/playlist_list.c (playlist_list_draw): Use
	gdk_fontset_load() instead of gdk_font_load() when loading the
	playlist font.  Got a lot of requests for this from people using
	multibyte fonts.

	* Effect/voice/about.c (voice_about): New email adress for Anders
	Carlsson.

	* xmms/skinwin.c (scan_skindir): Cleanup.

	* xmms/prefswin.c (gen_module_description): Cleanup.

Tue Jul 11 22:18:18 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* Released XMMS 1.2.2

Tue Jul 11 22:07:04 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* configure.in: Don't use libxml if the major version is different
	from 1.  libxml v2 is not compatible.

	* libxmms/Makefile.am: Set the path to the intl dir explicitly.
	top_builddir is different here.

Tue Jul 11 14:56:04 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.c, xmms/playlistwin.c, xmms/equalizer.c, xmms/dock.c:
	It is possible to get configure-event's for windows that are not
	visible, so we now check for that in the configure-event
	handlers.  This bug could cause XMMS to exit with a GDK error if
	for example a window was shown and then hidden again rapidly.

Sat Jul  8 02:27:38 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* */Makefile.am: Added -I$(top_builddir)/intl to INCLUDES where it
	was missing.
	
	* libxmms/Makefile.am: Set automake rules to foreign, and removed
	AUTHORS, COPYING, ChangeLog, INSTALL, NEWS and README.  These
	files were either not used or copies of files in the top
	directory.

	* xmms/controlsocket.c (check_ctrlsocket): Incorrectly casted to
	guint32 instead of guint32*.  Removed a couple of tests that did
	nothing.

	* Output/OSS/audio.c, Output/esd/audio.c: Avoid using void pointer
	arithmetics.

	* General/song_change/song_change.c: Added a include.

	* configure.in: Removed some incorrect AC_DEFINE's that had
	sneaked in, and that prevented the NLS detection from working as
	expected.  In particular, --disable-nls should work now.

Thu Jul  6 17:18:22 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/eq_slider.c (eqslider_set_mainwin_text): Changed the type
	of some strings from gchar[] to gchar*, due to the paranthesis we
	get from the NLS macros.

	* xmms/controlsocket.c (check_ctrlsocket): Avoid using void
	pointer arithmetics.

	* xmms/main.h: Fixed a typo: xmms_quit_cb -> mainwin_quit_cb.

	* xmms/util.[ch]: Removed find_file() that is not used.

	* xmms/pluginenum.c (add_plugin): Duplicate the argument instead
	of depending on the caller to allocate space for it.
	(scan_plugins): Close the directory stream.  Cleanup.

	* gnomexmms/gnomexmms.c: #include i18n.h.

	* xmms/main.c (mainwin_adjust_balance_motion): Fixed a buffer
	overflow that occured with some translations.
	(read_volume): Ditto.
	Reported by: Eric Sadit Tellez Avila

	* xmms/main.c (idle_func): Change the time display from MM:SS to
	HH:MM at 99:59, not at 99:00.
	Reported by: Vesa Halttunen <vesuri@jormas.com>

	* xmms/playlist_list.c (playlist_list_draw): Minor cleanup.

	* xmms/playlist.c (playlist_get_info_text): Cleanup.

Wed Jul  5 09:28:24 EDT 2000  Logan Hanks  <logan@xmms.org>

	* General/song_change/song_change.c: Added more format codes for
	convenience.  This list is now:

	  %F - frequency (in hertz)
	  %c - number of channels
	  %f - filename (full path)
	  %l - length (in milliseconds)
	  %n - name
	  %r - rate
	  %s - name
	  %t - playlist position

Fri Jun 30 22:14:48 GMT 2000  Chris Wilson  <jakdaw@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.c xmms/equalizer.c: Removed global_accel - it's no longer
	required since the equalizer and playlist now pass unhandled key 
	events to the mainwin.

Fri Jun 30 02:50:05 CEST 2000  Derrik Pates  <dpates@dsdk12.net>

	* xmms/playlist.c: Changed several 'pos > 0' position checks to
	'pos >= 0' - noticed that when a group of files or a .m3u/pls file
	gets dropped in the playlist window _on top_ of an existing entry,
	all items are added in reverse. Whoops.

Thu Jun 29 22:24:01 GMT 2000  Chris Wilson  <jakdaw@xmms.org>

	* xmms/equalizer.c xmms/playlistwin.c: playlist window and
	equalizer window now pass unhandled keypresses onto the main
	window (eg left and right etc)

Tue Jun 27 16:09:41 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): New languages: "pl", "el_GR".

	* gnomexmms/gnomexmms.c (main): Call setlocale().

Mon Jun 26 08:33:17 CDT 2000  Ryan Weaver <ryanw@xmms.org>

	* xmms.spec.in: Fixed issue resulting in bad exit status of
	%build if env variable LINGUAS wasn't set and we tried to unset it.

Mon Jun 26 01:32:48 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/playlistwin.c, xmms/main.[ch]: Remember the directory where
	we last saved or loaded a playlist.
	Patch by: Vesa Halttunen <vesuri@jormas.com>

	* xmms/playlistwin.c, xmms/util.[ch]  : Made
	util_filebrowser_is_dir() non static, and use it when loading
	playlists too.

	* xmms/prefswin.c (prefswin_apply_changes): Save config to disk on
	ok/apply.

	* xmms/playlist_list.c (playlist_list_button_press_cb): Handle a
	non-working playlist font gracefully.

Fri Jun 23 09:40:59 CDT 2000  Ryan Weaver  <ryanw@infohwy.com>

	* /cvs/xmms/xmms.spec.in: Added Funky hack to determine what
	packages provide libmikmod and libmikmod-config.

Thu Jun 22 16:44:38 EDT 2000  Logan Hanks  <logan@xmms.org>

	* Input/mpg123/mpg123.c: More minor changes to the get_song_time routine.

Thu Jun 22 14:55:13 EDT 2000  Logan Hanks  <logan@xmms.org>

	* libxmms/Makefile.am, libxmms/formatter.c, libxmms/formatter.h:
	Added a generic text formatter (like a stripped down printf).

	* General/song_change/song_change.c: Now uses the formatter instead
	of sprintf to build the command line string (much safer).

	* Input/mpg123/mpg123.c: Very minor one-line change to force the
	calculation of a song's length to be the same both before playback
	and during.  This discrepancy was causing the song_change plugin
	to trigger twice.

Wed Jun 21 12:12:16 CEST 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@xmms.org>

	* xmms/main.c (read_config): Set default playlist font to a sane
	one, even if there is no config file.

Tue Jun 20 15:44:06 EDT 2000  Logan Hanks  <logan@xmms.org>
	
	* libxmms/xmmsctrl.c: Fixed memory leak in xmms_remote_playlist
	(courtesy of Doug MacEachern)

	we have deinitialized plugins.

	* xmms/controlsocket.c (check_ctrlsocket): Make sure to avoid that
	cleanup_ctrlsocket() don't deadlock on quit.

Mon Feb  7 15:55:52 CST 2000  Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>

	* xmms.spec.in: Changed install method to accommodate for locale
	files.  make DESTDIR=/blah install does not include the locale
	for some reason. I have to use make prefix=/blah/usr
	sysconfdir=/blah/etc install to get around this.

Mon Feb  7 15:35:17 CST 2000  Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>

	* xmms.spec.in: fixed turnicated Requires: line in mikmod
	subpackage.

	* Input/mpg123/id3_frame.c, Input/mpg123/id3_tag.c: Includes
 	<sys/param.h> fot ntohl() (rather than <netinet/in.h>).

Tue Jan 25 02:23:39 CET 2000  Håvard Kvålen  <havardk@sol.no>

	* Input/cdaudio/cddb.c (cddb_log): Removed the dynamic updating of
	the log-window temporarily. play get called both with the

	all characters that are special to the shell inside double quotes.

Mon Jan 17 15:15:16 CET 2000  Peter Alm  <peter@xmms.org>
	
	* General/song_change/song_change.c: We now reset the SIGCHLD handler

	recognizing files by content rather than filename extension.

	* xmms/input.c (input_play): Set the "playing" flag even if no
	input-plugin recognizes the file. This way entries in the playlist
	where the inputplugin has been disabled will be skipped. 
	(input_stop): Made sure we always clear the "playing" flag.

	* xmms/prefswin.c (create_prefs_window): Moved the buttons around
	a litle.

	* xmms/main.c (mainwin_url_ok_clicked), xmms/playlistwin.c
	(playlistwin_url_ok_clicked) : Files are added to the playlist
	with playlist_add_url_string() now for more flexibility.

	* xmms/playlistwin.c (playlistwin_url_ok_clicked): Made it a litle
	bit better at deciding whether we should prepend a "http://" or

	mainwin_show_add_url_window() and
	playlistwin_show_add_url_window() to util_crate_add_url_window().

	* xmms/playlist.c (playlist_set_position): Fixed crash if the
	position was of range.

	playlistwindow broke with GTK+-1.2.4 because we did not call
	gdk_window_resize().

	* Effect/voice/voice.c (mod_samples): The voice-removal plugin was
	somehow believing there was twice as many samples as there really
	was.

	* xmms/playlistwin.c (playlistwin_show_add_url_window): The entry
	is active when the window is opened.

	* xmms/main.[ch], xmms/playlistwin.[ch], xmms/prefswin.c: New
	option: Userdefined pause between songs.

	* xmms/playlistwin.c (playlistwin_url_ok_clicked): If a new url
	has no "http://" prefix, one is prepended to the string.

Tue Aug 24 20:50:00 CEST 1999  Derrik Pates  <dpates@dsdk12.net

	* xmms/playlist.c: Added a second call to scan_skins() in the
	random skin selection code to make sure the skin selected in the
	skin selector window is the same as the skin in use.

	* xmms/skinwin.c: Removed the gtk_clist_clear() from
	show_skin_window, and moved it into scan_skins. Also added
	gtk_clist_freeze() and gtk_clist_thaw() before and after where the
	list is updated.

Tue Aug 24 08:45:03 CEST 1999  Derrik Pates  <dpates@dsdk12.net>

	* xmms/main.c: Added lines in the configuration load and save
	routines to store and retrieve the value of
	cfg.random_skin_on_play (and to give it a reasonable default).
